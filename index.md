# Negotiator

*Formerly known as "KISS Privacy"*

## Chrome Extension

Negotiator is a chrome extension which gives users who are familiar with http requests the tool to simply block and modify them permanently.

## The web is not a done deal

You no longer need to blindly accept what the web offers. This extension allows you to set your own terms. Simple http request and response filtering for advanced users.
